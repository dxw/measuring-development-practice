# 3. Use GitHub Actions

Date: 2021-11-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Lots of discussion have taken place on how to approach this problem space, all
the proof of concept work we have used Github Actions.

## Decision

Use [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) as an approach.

## Consequences

Whilst GitHub is our preference, any work with code not on GitHub, will not be
able to utilise this work.
