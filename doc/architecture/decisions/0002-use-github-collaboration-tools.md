# 2. Use GitHub collaboration tools

Date: 2021-11-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

This is a project built for developer by developers. Keeping the administration
of the project and the code coupled together means there is only one place to
look for information.

## Decision

We will use the full suite of GitHub collaboration tools to help us build,
including issues, discussions, wiki.

## Consequences

Moving the project off GitHub at any point in the future will be made more
difficult by this decisions. However we consider the benefits having everything
in one place outweigh the risks.
